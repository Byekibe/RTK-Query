This project demonstrates a full-stack application using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, MySQL database for data storage, and RTK Query for efficient data fetching. Users can interact with the React application to access and manage data stored in the MySQL database.

Key Features:

Interactive React interface for user interaction.
Server-side API endpoints built with Flask for data manipulation.
Efficient data fetching and caching with RTK Query.
Secure communication between frontend and backend.
